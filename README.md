Study notes (about coding), blogs, memos, pieces of code, etc.

## Languages

Only cultural specific things - such as platforms, tools, problems - will be written in Chinese for the sake of convenience. (People can hardly understand the content anyways.) Some technical things may still remain in English.

Use `-label:"Language:Chinese"` in issues page to filter out Chinese notes.
